                        <h3>The Devon Rex</h3>
                            <p id="p-home1">
                                The Devon Rex is a tall-eared and short-haired breed of cat that emerged in Devon, England in the late 1950's. It is suspected that
                                they're the product of a spontaneous genetic mutation amongst the local stray cats that lived around the mining communities in the region. 
                                First discovered by Beryl Cox in 1959, a tomcat with a soft and curly coat was found to peruse the town of Buckfastleigh in search of a mate. Beryl initially tried to domesticate him,
                                but found that it was impossible. However, when a kitten named Kirlee was born to a litter of straight-haired kittens by a stray calico, Beryl knew she had stumbled upon a new breed entirely.
                                Initially thought to be related to the Cornish rex, test breeding revealed that they are not related to one another at all (genetically). A product of happenstance, 
                                the Devon Rex is undoubtetly a treasure.

                        <p id="p-home2">
                            Devon Rex kittens are active and full of energy, and at Kurakats we take special care of our babies to make sure they love and trust humans. Often
                            described as a mix between a cat, dog, and monkey, your devon rex kitten will have an inclination to climb up on shoulders or insist on being held.
                            They are often regarded as one of the most intelligent breeds amongst domestic felines, exhibiting a kind of intelligence that one can only understand
                            after experiencing one themselves. Be prepared to be brought a vast assortment of toys and strange items, as these kittens will take objects as toys and bring 
                            them to their beloved human for a game of fetch or chase. At bedtime, they enjoy a close snuggle with their chosen human companion, typically occupying spaces
                            that are close to the head, shoulders, and neck.

                        <h3>Anatomy</h3>
                        <p id="p-home3">
                            Devon Rex cats are short-haired, with soft and curly fur. They have very slender bodies with a unique stature that is more easily observable in adulthood.  Kittens are born with a coat of this fur, but soon after shed it to make room for their
                            adult coat, which can take up to twelve months to grow. Devons do shed, but their fur is so short and small that it's hardly noticable at all. They're considered
                            to be hypoallergenic by some because of their coat. Kurakats are bred to maintain a beautiful, dandruff-free coat that should give even the most sensitive
                            folks a break from the usual straight-haired allergic reactions.
